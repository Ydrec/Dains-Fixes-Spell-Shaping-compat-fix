# Dains-Fixes-Spell-Shaping-compat-fix
microfix for Spell shaping compat so that it consumes mana instead of deleting all ff damage regardless. 
Tested to properly follow original spell shaping formula and adjust for difficulty. 
Download repository as zip, extract Dain's Fixes folder and then merge it with the same folder from original mod or manually grab and replace files in zz_Compatibility
